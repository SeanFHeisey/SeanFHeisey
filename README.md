## Hi  ðŸ‘‹ My name is Sean Heisey
# Software Engineer
I am an undergraduate student studying a Bachelor of Computer Science at the University of Central Florida. I passed the Computer Science Foundation exam on my first attempt which consists of hand writing data structures in C. I am self-motivated and enjoy applying my CS knowledge to solve real world problems. I am actively pursuing an internship position as a Software Engineer before I graduate because I am eager to apply my knowledge and soft skills to new projects. Iâ€™m excited to collaborate with team members and gain professional work experience within my field. I am an ambitious person with multiple side hustles and I strive to be successful by priotitizing my mental and physical health. My hard work and dedication mixed with my ability to learn new skills is what separates me from the rest. My confidence and independence is what keeps me going in this industry. My goal is to break into the software engineering industry and showcase my skills, ability to learn, lead, and make smart decisions.
